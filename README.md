Follow-up to shit-happens.  

This project describes the heterogeneity of happiness trajectories around life events.  

It uses the [lcmm](https://cecileproust-lima.github.io/lcmm/index.html) package to estimate a latent class linear mixed model with `hlme()` on happiness scores around distinct life events (e..g, `lefnw`) from the HILDA survey.
